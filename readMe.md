# EFI Folders for Hackintosh Systems
I've built a few different hackintosh systems using a few different components and have compiled the EFI folders here.
All tested up to macOS Mojave 10.14.4.

## Current System Folders
 - Asus Z370i, Intel i7 8700K, Asus RX580 Strix 
 - Asus Z370a, Intel i7 8700K, Asus RX580 Strix (NO USB SSDT)
 - Asus Z370i, Intel i9 9900K, Asus Vega 64 Strix
 
 ## Issues
  - AsMedia USB 3.1 Gen2 ports dont have drivers in macOS therefore their functionality is limited (disconnect on sleep, USB 2.0 speeds, etc...)
